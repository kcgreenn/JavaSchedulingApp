Part C. I commented about my Lambda Expressions in the AddApointmentController.generateContactOptions and AddAppointmentController.handleCreateClick methods.

My additional report for section A3f tracks the frequency of appointments for each hour in the day. This allows the user to see the most popular times for appointments. I display this information in a line chart in the Reports Pane of the Dashboard Scene.

How to Run the Program: Extract the zipped folder and open it in NetBeans, than press F6 or or click the Run tab and select Run.
